knowing my skin type
If your skin feels tight, your skin is likely dry;
If there is noticeable shine on your nose and forehead, your skin is mostly likely normal/combination;
If there is shine on your cheeks in addition to your forehead and nose, you most likely have oily skin.

There are five basic skin types - normal, oily, dry, combination and sensitive.


Oily skin happens when the sebaceous glands in the skin make too much sebum Sebum is the waxy,
 oily substance that protects and hydrates the skin,
 Sebum is vital for keeping the skin healthy;
 However, too much sebum can lead to oily skin, clogged pores, and acne.
